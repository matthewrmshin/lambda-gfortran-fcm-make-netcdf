# lambda-gfortran-fcm-make-netcdf

Dockerfile based on Amazon Lambda Python 3.7 runtime Environment with GFortran + FCM Make + netCDF.
Allows easy lambda packaging of executables with netCDF libraries built with GFortran.
Executable should be run as a subprocess by a Python lambda handler function.
Example to follow soon.
